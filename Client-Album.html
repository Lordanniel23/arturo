	<h2>Wedding Photos</h2>

		<h2>Mr & Mrs Williams</h2>

		<button type="submit" name="submit">Check Photos</button>
		<p>Over the years, I’ve come to find that my absolute favorite weddings to date – from the images to the unforgettable memories made with my brides and grooms – have been ones where I’ve walked away with genuine friendships that I’ve developed with my couples through being their wedding photographer.</p>

		<p>it will cover all of the critical business aspects of wedding photography, including developing a detailed business plan, marketing your talents, and setting your prices. She’ll take you on a real wedding event where you can see first-hand how to shoot that special day, including advice on posing, lighting, and timing.</p>

		<button type="submit" name="submit">Check Photos</button>
		<p>While I think having digital photos are great and all in this day of age, I don't think they were meant to sit on an iPhone or a usb drive in a draw. I believe photos are meant to be printed and displayed in your home to share with your friends and family. Wedding albums are meant to be passed down to your grandchildren and become family heirlooms for future generations.</p>

	<h2>Family Photos</h2>
	<div class="feature">
		<div>
		<h2>Wilburt’s Family</h2>
		<img src="images/family1.jpg" alt="family1"><br>
		<button type="submit" name="submit">Check Photos</button>
		<p>We all have times in our lives that we look back on and think “I wish…" Think about how fast children grow up... We ask every high school Senior we photograph if they have ever been professionally photographed and the answer is overwhelmingly, "no." With the hustle and bustle of modern life, an occasion that brings an entire family together is a rare event.</p>

		<h2>Adam’s Family</h2>	
		<img src="images/family2.jpg" alt="family2"><br>
		<button type="submit" name="submit">Check Photos</button>
		<p>If you would like to, I am open to you bringing along items that represent you and your family. This might be your family pet or anything that represents the core of your family values. Some families bring soft toys, a favourite soccer ball or instrument. If we don’t end up using the props rest assured we will get plenty of amazing shots.</p>

		<h2>Micheal’s Family</h2>

		<button type="submit" name="submit">Check Photos</button>
		<p>We can’t stop the clock but we can capture this moment and create a lasting memory! But for us to do this, you have to decide that the time is now, not in an ‘I wish’ moment! You’ll be glad you did!</p>

		<h2>Reunions</h2>
		<p>We offer a beautiful full color ten section 11" x 8.5" memory book and design the book the way that you want. Reunion Committee's love our memory books. We also offer our memory book printing service to those Reunion Committees or individual photographers who choose to do their own photography but desire a memory book of the reunion, as well as to independent photographers.</p>

		<h2>Seminars</h2>
		<p>on Basic and Advanced photography, conducted by the FPPF every month the whole year round, are the most effective and most reasonably priced short photo workshops in Manila. Over 10,000 graduates have attended the workshops since 1995, many of whom have gone on to become professional photographers and to win national and international contests against more experienced photographers.</p>

		<h2>Graduations</h2>
		<p>Ideally, the best time to schedule a senior portrait session is anytime beginning Spring of your Junior year to early Spring of Senior year. Of course, you can always schedule your session another time, but to ensure your choice of dates and venues, it is best to begin early!</p>
