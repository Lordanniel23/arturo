		<h2>Creative Photo Collection<br>P899</h2>
		<p>Photo albums typically come in a few standard sizes and orientations to better fit standard photo prints. Choose the best option for you based on the orientation and number of photos you’d like to include in your album. We included an 8.5″ x 11″ standard letter for reference.</p>

		<h2>Year-End Photo Album<br>P1100</h2><br>
		<p>Portrait orientations tend to have a professional look and feel which makes them ideal for graduation photo albums, yearbooks or when you have a lot of photos in unique or up close angles. Popular sizes include 11×8, 16×12 and 14×11. Portrait photographs definitely take a different set of skills and have a different feel in general. When your priority is to showcase your portraits, these sizes are your best options.</p>

		<h2>Wedding Photo Album<br>P1299</h2>
		<p>Square albums are great for when you want your album or photo book to have a sleek and modern feel. They’re also our go-to recommendation for those who have an equal number of portrait and landscape photos as it can easily accommodate a mixture of layouts and orientations. Most standard square photo album sizes include 8×8, 10×10 and 12×12.</p>

		<h2>Family Photo Album<br>P1500</h2>
		<p>Landscape photo albums are great for travel and general family photos as most of these photos tend to be taken in this orientation. They also tend to have a more classic feel than a square or portrait oriented album. Some popular sizes include 6×8, 8×11, 11×14 and 12×16.</p>
