		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>When starting a photo blog, you’ll want to choose a theme with a wider content area to help to showcase your photos at full size. Similarly, choosing a theme that is minimalistic helps to reduce any noise that may detract from the focus on your photography.</p>
		<p>I can promise you won’t regret capturing beautiful family memories with a family photographer. In years to come your photos will hold more and more sentimental value as you look back on a time that once was.</p>
